# Signal_Processing_Graphs
 
The overall aim of this paper is to be able to perfectly reconstruct a given
graph(directed or undirected). Formulating a proper sampling theory(which works on both
directed and undirected graphs) is the main objective of this paper. Generally sampling
theory on graphs are not very well understood since graphs lie on complicated and irregular
structures. Traversing a graph cannot be done very simply with a proper sampling theory in
mind. This is much more easily done in a 2D format as we can see with the Nyquist-Shannon
sampling theorem. This paper covers sampling through the usage of discrete signal
processing and uses simple linear algebra. It also covers the the process in which the
sampling operator is designed for a given graph. We generally search for the qualified
sampling operator which is designed to guarantee perfect recovery and robustness to noise.
